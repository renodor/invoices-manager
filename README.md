# Invoices Manager

This is a personal webapp to create invoices for my clients.

I used this personal project to build my first webapp using Rails 7 and get familiar with Hotwire.
(The codebase is freely inspired from the final result of [this tutorial](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails))

### Built With
* [Ruby on Rails 7](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/)

### Aditional plugins
* [Grover](https://github.com/Studiosity/grover) (Export HTML to PDF)
